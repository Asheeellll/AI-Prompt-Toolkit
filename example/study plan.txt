Perfect. With 30 hours total and 2 hours per day, we’re looking at 15 days (~2 weeks) of study. I’ll create a flexible, realistic, beginner-friendly plan for Python Basics, highlighting priority topics and including breaks.

Python Basics 2-Week Study Plan (2 hrs/day, 30 hrs total)
Day	Time	Topic	Focus / Notes
Day 1	0:00–2:00	Python Fundamentals	Variables, data types, basic syntax, comments. Hands-on practice.
Day 2	0:00–2:00	Operators & Expressions	Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment operators. Mini exercises.
Day 3	0:00–2:00	Control Flow (If-Else)	if, elif, else. Write 3 small programs.
Day 4	0:00–2:00	Loops	for and while loops, break & continue. Emphasize iteration logic.
Day 5	0:00–2:00	Functions	def, parameters, return. Write 2–3 functions. Priority topic.
Day 6	0:00–2:00	Data Structures – Lists & Tuples	List operations (append, pop, slicing), tuple basics. Hands-on practice.
Day 7	0:00–2:00	Data Structures – Sets & Dictionaries	Set operations, dict creation & access, mutability vs immutability.
Day 8	0:00–2:00	Input & Output	input(), print(), f-strings, formatting. Small programs using user input.
Day 9	0:00–2:00	String Methods & Manipulation	upper(), lower(), split(), join(). Practice exercises.
Day 10	0:00–2:00	List Comprehension & Loops	Transform loops into comprehensions, mini projects. Priority topic.
Day 11	0:00–2:00	Error Handling & Debugging	try-except, common Python errors, debugging tips.
Day 12	0:00–2:00	Modules & Libraries	import, standard libraries (math, random, datetime). Practice small examples.
Day 13	0:00–2:00	Mini Projects – Part 1	Build small programs combining variables, loops, functions, and data structures.
Day 14	0:00–2:00	Mini Projects – Part 2	Continue projects, include string and file operations if ready.
Day 15	0:00–2:00	Revision & Self-Quiz	Revise all topics, attempt 10–15 MCQs, redo exercises, summarize notes.
Break & Rest Recommendations

Take 5–10 min micro-breaks after every 40–45 minutes if needed.

Avoid distractions; keep phone on silent.

Optional: stretch or walk for 5 minutes before starting the next day.

Priority Topics

Functions, Control Flow, Data Structures, List Comprehensions – spend extra practice time.

Mini-projects (Days 13–14) reinforce everything practically.

Flexibility Tips

If a topic takes longer, adjust by merging lighter topics (e.g., string methods + I/O).
